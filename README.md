### written by t.j. loudon. fixed (a lot) by HelloWorld
the purpose of this script is to scrape data from [Johns Hopkins University's covid-19 map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

this was written in about a day and a half (until HelloWorld helped me fix a lot of stuff I needed help with. huge props)
